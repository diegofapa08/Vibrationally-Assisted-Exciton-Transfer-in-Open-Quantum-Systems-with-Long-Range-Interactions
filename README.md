Sample codes for numerical simulations performed in the paper: Vibrationally Assisted Exciton Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions

The code DimerEvolution.m can be used to simulate the dynamics of the two-monomer (dimer) case. This code can be used to generate Figs 2, 3, and 4 of the paper.

The code threeqMonomerEvolution.m is an extension of the dimer code with increases the number of qubits per site from 2 to 3. Similar codes can be created to further increase the number of qubits per site to generate plots similar to those in Fig. 5 (a) and (b).

The code TrimerEvolution.m is an extension of the dimer code with increases the number of sites from 2 to 3 while keeping two qubits per site. Similar codes can be created to further increase the number of sites to generate plots similar to those in Fig. 5 (c) and (d).
